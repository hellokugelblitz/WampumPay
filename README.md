# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Wampum Pay ðŸŸ£

It works like Venmo but with _fake money_, and has some social media features. It was built in React Native with a Firebase auth system and data management. I credit the idea for this app to Henry Shwabe!

### 1.0 Features:
- Authentication and account creation using Firebase.
- Payment system with in-app currency between users (the Wampum).
- Leaderboard with up-to-date display.
- The user can view transactions between themselves and other users.
- The user can add favorite users or 'friends', who will appear at the top of their payments window.
- The user can update profile their information or delete their profile, their data will remain persistent even after account removal.
- The users receive push notifications when a payment is received.
